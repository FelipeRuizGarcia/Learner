### How to Stay Deeply Focused Despite Noise, Interruptions, and Pressure

1.  **Drop everything** you're doing, no matter where you are.
2.  **Be clear on your priority**:

        - _"Deciding means letting go."_
        - By choosing one task, you're accepting that others **won’t** be done right now.

3.  **Physically release distractions**—put things down, take a breath.

#### Handling Intrusive Thoughts

I constantly ask myself about intrusive thoughts:

Can I discard this right away?

If not, then:  
Is it in a safe place where I can continue it in the future?  
If not, then:  
Is it worth saving now? Is it an important milestone?  
If not, then...

-   **Write them down** but don’t engage with them.
-   Try to **discard** them instead of letting them take over.
-   **Intrusive thoughts** vs. **Deep focus thoughts**—know the difference.

#### List of DON'Ts

Thinking CLEARLY "NO gona do that now"
Don’t get sidetracked by things that aren’t worth it.

DON'T obsess over things that aren’t important at the moment.

Don’t switch tasks.

time doesn’t matter, nor does anything else — the only thing that matters is completing the task.

#### Turn Off All Notifications—Completely.

_"I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about,
and express it in numbers,
you know something about it;
but when you cannot measure it,
when you cannot express it in numbers,
your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.

If you can not meausure it, you can not control it "_

### Shortcuts Layers

If you realize that you follow a process twice, you should learn a shortcut / automation to do it quickly.
Investing in speed your workflow is saving time in the future:
All the softwares provides shortcuts, from Excel until Youtube.

I really suggest learn the key shortcuts from layers, ( like OSI model ):

i.e
L0: OS shortcuts: Like copy, paste, select all, delete, change the focus from other windows, resize the windows, change to full screen, etc etc...
Typing: how to delete the entere word?

L1: Apps: Chrome? Firefox ?: Close tab, move tab, change to tab, duplicat tab etc etc...
L2? website: Google sheets? : how to insert the time
L3? Plugings, frameworks: You can also add pluging to extend the behaviors and shortcuts available.

Follow the process and automate what you want.

#### The intention is not use the mouse, and go directly that you want.

### Tools

#### clockify

Software, Browser Extension, and Mobile App to track time in apps, websites etc.
