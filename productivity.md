# Productivity
### All the strategies, habits, tools that I use to be productive.


_"I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, 
and express it in numbers, 
you know something about it; 
but when you cannot measure it, 
when you cannot express it in numbers, 
your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.

<br>
If you can not meausure it, you can not control it "_

\- Lord Kelvin


# Shortcuts
If you realize that you follow a process twice, you should learn a shortcut / automation to do it quickly.
Investing in speed your workflow is saving time in the future:
All the softwares provides shortcuts, from Excel until Youtube. 


I really suggest learn the key shortcuts from layers, ( like OSI model ):

First, make sure you are able to type fast.

i.e
L0: OS shortcuts: Like copy, paste, select all, delete, change the focus from other windows, resize the windows, change to full screen, etc etc...
Typing: how to delete the entere word?

L1: Apps: Chrome? Firefox ?: Close tab, move tab, change to tab, duplicat tab etc etc...
L2? website: Google sheets? : how to insert the time
L3? Plugings, frameworks:  You can also add pluging to extend the behaviors and shortcuts available.

Follow the process and automate what you want.
