# Productivity
### All the strategies, tools, and that I use to be focused and productive.


_"I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, 
and express it in numbers, 
you know something about it; 
but when you cannot measure it, 
when you cannot express it in numbers, 
your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.
<br>
<br>
If you can not meausure it, you can not control it "_

\- Lord Kelvin
