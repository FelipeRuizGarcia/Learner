_"I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about,
and express it in numbers,
you know something about it;
but when you cannot measure it,
when you cannot express it in numbers,
your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.
<br>
<br>
If you can not meausure it, you can not control it "_

### Shortcuts Layers

If you realize that you follow a process twice, you should learn a shortcut / automation to do it quickly.
Investing in speed your workflow is saving time in the future:
All the softwares provides shortcuts, from Excel until Youtube.

I really suggest learn the key shortcuts from layers, ( like OSI model ):

i.e
L0: OS shortcuts: Like copy, paste, select all, delete, change the focus from other windows, resize the windows, change to full screen, etc etc...
Typing: how to delete the entere word?

L1: Apps: Chrome? Firefox ?: Close tab, move tab, change to tab, duplicat tab etc etc...
L2? website: Google sheets? : how to insert the time
L3? Plugings, frameworks: You can also add pluging to extend the behaviors and shortcuts available.

Follow the process and automate what you want.

#### The intention is not use the mouse, and go directly that you want.

### Tools

#### clockify

Software, Browser Extension, and Mobile App to track time in apps, websites etc.
