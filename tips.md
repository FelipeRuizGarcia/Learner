Tips:

` the cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing -Seth Godin `

* Think global, even the development is for a short time period 
or the scope is limited.
Once you think globally, 
think in count all the resources ( even not are available at that moment )
and make a plan that considerate all the resources . 
You will find the time development reduces a lot of time for that.
