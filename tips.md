## use the formal languange for context

At times, development utilizes
tools or specific scenarios that involve a specialized vocabulary.
It is essential to always learn the
"formal concepts," also known as the "glossary,"
including terms related to tools, databases, backends, platforms, etc.

## Master with codebases

Remove all the noisy notifications and configure the external repos as you need.
Only releases ?
Only bug fixes ?
Ignore at all ?

Dominate `git stash + origin + branches + worktree ` to switch and handle as much as possible with git / stash / worktrees

`git diff --color-words origin/dev`

if not possible compare with git, use tools
to compare files between codebases with $diff and also $shasum

`the cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing -Seth Godin`

-   About your learning, Think in long term: Invest time to follow the best practices.
    Formalize your learning with the best practices.
    If you think is not necessary at that time, I can assure you that what you are doing will be repeated in one way or another, so, be ready for that. Why ? So, you do not have time to do things in the best way, but you can do it two o more time?

-   Think global, even the development is for a short time period
    or the scope is limited:
    Once you think globally,
    think in count all the resources ( even not are available at that moment )
    and make a plan that considerate all the resources .
    You will find the time development reduces a lot of time for that.

-   Ensure that all the efforts that are developed going to be useful:
    Tests the components / functs as the final user immediately it is finished.
