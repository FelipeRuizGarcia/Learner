Learn and Share! Always Learning: My Own Roadmap; Open Source Open Knownledge

This repo includes workshops and references to "how to do something quickly".

Also, provides the Roadmap and Paths that I follow to master tools.

#### Workshops

Workshops are the best way to learn
In my Learning
the stages for the presenter and for the team are

1. Read:
   Only place reference links and key concepts

2. "Rewrite"
   Mark the shortest route to start, prepare the workarounds or the setup

3. Execute:
   In such a way that everyone in the session can go step by step

4. Present / Share / Teach:
   The presenter reinforce his knowledge

#### Rewriting Technique

The Revision and Rewriting Technique

What is it?

    It is an iterative process of improving and perfecting a text.
    It involves reworking the thinking from the initial draft to clarify, improve the writing, and transform the knowledge.
    It is an improvement function that requires time to think, make changes, and refine details.

Benefits

    Develops writing, organization, and communication skills.
    Fosters critical reflection and the ability to review and self-critique.
    Produces texts of higher quality, clarity, and coherence.
