# Learner
 Learn and Share! Always Learning.

This repo includes workshops and references to "how to do something quickly".

Also, provides the Roadmap and Paths that I follow to master tools.


#### Workshops
Workshops are the best way to learn
In my Learning
the stages for the presenter and for the team are

1. Read:
Only place reference links and key concepts

2. "Rewrite"
Mark the shortest route to start, prepare the workarounds or the setup

3. Execute:
In such a way that everyone in the session can go step by step

4. Present / Share / Teach:
The presenter reinforce his knowledge
