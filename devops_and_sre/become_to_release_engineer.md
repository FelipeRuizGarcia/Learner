# Release Engineer
Building and delivering software!!

#### Intro Philosophy
Release engineers and SREs work together to develop strategies for canarying changes, 
pushing out new releases without interrupting services, and rolling back features that demostrate problems.

## TLDR Concepts

### Self Service Model
Teams must be self-sufficient.
All the product releases should be automated using the necessary tools.
Build and deployment tools are truly automatic and only require
involvement if and when problems arise.


### High Velocity
Small changes per version!.
Releases quickly and frequently.
Artifacts are tested and best version of new build is deployed to prod! :
We have test results to make the best decision which and when release. 


### Hermetic Builds
The Artifact: the build of the product are only dependent on the known
version of compilers, dependencies, etc.


### Others

* Identifiability: Identify all the necessary tools, envs, Artifacts + all things requried for a product release.
* Reproducibility: Able to integrate sources, data, third-party and deployment externals of sw.
* Consistency: Have stable framework to be consistent.
* Agility: Implement the best engineering practices in the sw cycle's productivity.
