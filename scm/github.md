# Github

#### Github Actions

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions

Event-driver:

Event >  Workflow >  Job >  Steps ( Action or shell command )

Good practice:
Separate your common steps in Actions, outside the workflow file at:  `.github/actions/`
