### Tokens

You can clone repos with tokens, instead of user/pass

## Github Actions

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions

Event-driver:

Event > Workflow > Job > Steps ( Action or shell command )

Good practice:
Separate your common steps in Actions, outside the workflow file at: `.github/actions/`
