### ProTips
If possible, create an independent aws root account for each domain: and you can apply for credits for each account, instead of 1 credit for the account.

* Use AWS Resource Groups > Tag Editor, to list all the resources in the account.

* Deactivate all the unused AWS Regions at IAM > Account settings
