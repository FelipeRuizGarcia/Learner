### Notes For S3 Static website

redirects take time to propagate. 

If bucket is origin to cloudfront, cloudfront needs to indicate the resources of the static website
like `homepage.com/example/user`

#### Certificates

Create a cert that can be used under the domain as the main FQDN

  ```
  adapa.mx
  www.adapa.mx
  *.adapa.mx
  ```

#### CDN ( Cloudfront ) 

Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

#### DNS ( Route53 ) 

Considerate add the `www` record in both, DNS( route53 )  and CDN ( Cloudfront ) 
Most of the Browser redirect https content to www subdomain.

#### miscellaneous

There is not option to rename a bucket: You can create a new one cloning the configs from other.
