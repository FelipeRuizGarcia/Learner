## Notes

#### Certificates

Create a cert that can be used under the domain as
` *.adapa.mx`

#### Domain

Considerate add the `www` record in both, DNS( route53 )  and CDN ( Cloudfront ) 
Most of the Browser redirect https content to www subdomain.

#### miscellaneous

There is not option to rename a bucket: You can create a new one cloning the configs from other.
