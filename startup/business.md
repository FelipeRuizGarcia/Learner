### Feedback loop

A feedback loop is a process where the outputs of a system are routed back as inputs, forming a circuit or loop. It is a key concept in various fields, including control theory, cybernetics, and software engineering.

#### Negative Feedback Loop

A negative feedback loop is a process where a company listens to customers' complaints or grievances, and then uses that feedback to improve their products or customer service. The customer feedback (output) is used as input to redesign the product, creating a circular process.

### Raci Table

RACI table, also known as a RACI chart or matrix, is a tool used in project management to clarify and assign roles and responsibilities for various tasks within a project. The acronym RACI stands for:

    R - Responsible: The person or team responsible for completing the task.
    A - Accountable: The person or team ultimately responsible for the task and its outcome.
    C - Consulted: The person or team whose input is sought for the task.
    I - Informed: The person or team who needs to be kept updated on the task's progress.
